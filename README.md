# Relational Fusion Networks
This library contains a reference implementation of the Relational Fusion Network (RFN) introduced in the SIGSPATIAL'19 paper _Graph Convolutional Networks for Road Networks_ by Tobias Skovgaard Jepsen, Christian S. Jensen, and Thomas Dyhre Nielsen. You may find an extended preprint version of the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11567).

You can install the required dependencies using `pipenv` or `pip` by executing `pipenv install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`, respectively, in the root directory.
See `Tutorial.ipynb` for instructions on how to use the library.
