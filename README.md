# Relational Fusion Networks
This library contains a reference implementation of the Relational Fusion Network (RFN). The RFN first appeared in a paper presented at _ACM SIGSPATIAL 2019_ [1] which is available through the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3347146.3359094). An extended version of this paper has since appeared in _IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems_ [2] and is available through [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9167450). A preprint of the extended paper is also available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09030).

You can install the required dependencies using `pipenv` or `pip` by executing `pipenv install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`, respectively, in the root directory. See `Tutorial.ipynb` for instructions on how to use the library.
